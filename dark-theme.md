# Dark Theme

---


- [Install](#install)

By default, LaRecipe's default theme is the light one. However, for dark theme lovers, we published a separate package so you can have the dark theme as shown in the picture below.

## install

```bash
composer require binarytorch/larecipe-dark-theme
```

Once isntalled, the theme will be activated automatically 😃
